                        Since 2020, I've enjoyed designing and developing websites both as a passion and a career choice. In the past, I loved drawing, even though I wasn't very good and would trace everything. With website design, I feel like I'm back to drawingâ€”only now, I'm creating freely without needing a guide to trace.

                        A big passion of mine is working out/fitness. I try my best not to take more than one rest day a week. One day, I want to own both a fitness product & a gym, building both to improve how everyone views exercise. That's a big reason why I created my website <span className='font-bold'>gym<span className='text-[#3175b1]'>skii</span></span>. I want to start by improving how people track and act on their progress!
