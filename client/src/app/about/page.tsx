                        Since 2023, I've enjoyed designing and developing websites both as a passion and a career choice. I completed my primary education in West Bengal and subsequently pursued my secondary and higher secondary education. I'm passionate about computer science, particularly full-stack web development and cybersecurity.

                        A big passion of mine is working out/fitness. I try my best not to take more than one rest day a week. One day, I want to own both a fitness product & a gym, building both to improve how everyone views exercise. That's a big reason why I created my website <span className='font-bold'><span className='text-[#3175b1]'></span></span>. I want to start by improving how people track and act on their progress!
