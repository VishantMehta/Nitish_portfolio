                    Since 2020, I've enjoyed designing and developing websites both as a passion and a career choice. Even earlier, I used to love drawing, even though I was terrible and would trace everything. With website design, I feel like I'm back to drawingâ€”only now, I'm creating freely without needing a guide to trace.

                    A big passion of mine is working out/fitness, I try my best not to take more than one rest day a week. I one day want to own both a fitness product
                    & a gym, building both with the goal of improving how everyone views exercise. That's a big reason why  I created my website <span className='font-bold'>gym<span className='text-[#3175b1]'>skii</span></span>,
                    I want to start by improving how people track and act on their progress!
